#Shared Shopping List app

I love using Clear for shopping lists, but it has no support for shared lists, so it's not 100% ideal for managing shopping lists with Lilly.

## Basic idea:
A single screen list app, which syncs everything that happens immediately (Pusher.com?)

People can either merge or replace their own list (using a barcode image), but not manage more than one list.

Swipe to delete, swipe other way to mark complete

**Killer feature**: you can trigger a push notification (e.g. accessory button) to all other users of that list, to request them to buy X (useful to prompt them whilst they're out)
